## Demographic Data Analyzer
**Nhlapo Nkululeko**

The **Demographic Data Analyzer** is a tool that looks at data about people, such as **age**, **education**, and **income**, from a **<span style="color:red">CSV</span>** file. It uses the **<span style="color:blue">pandas</span>** library to handle and analyze this data. The analyzer answers questions like how many people of each **race** are in the dataset, the average age of **men**, and the percentage of people with a **<span style="color:green">Bachelor's degree</span>**. 

It also checks how many people with **higher education** (<span style="color:green">Bachelor's</span>, <span style="color:green">Master's</span>, or <span style="color:green">Doctorate</span>) earn more than 50K compared to those with less education. Additionally, it finds the **<span style="color:red">minimum hours</span>** people work per week and what percentage of those people earn more than 50K. 

The tool also identifies the **country** with the highest percentage of high earners and the most common high-paying **job** in India. Overall, the Demographic Data Analyzer helps to understand **patterns and trends** in the demographic data.
