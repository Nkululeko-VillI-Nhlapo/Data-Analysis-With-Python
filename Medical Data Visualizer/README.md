# Medical Data Visualizer

## Medical Examination Data Analysis and Visualization

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing health data obtained from a medical examination dataset using Python libraries such as **pandas**, **seaborn**, and **matplotlib**. The dataset, loaded from `medical_examination.csv`, contains various health indicators for a group of patients.

## Files

### 1. `medical_examination.csv`

This CSV file serves as the primary data source for the project. It includes the following columns:
- `id`: Patient ID
- `age`: Age of the patient in days
- `gender`: Gender of the patient (1 = female, 2 = male)
- `height`: Height of the patient in cm
- `weight`: Weight of the patient in kg
- `ap_hi`: Systolic blood pressure
- `ap_lo`: Diastolic blood pressure
- `cholesterol`: Cholesterol level (1 = normal, 2 = above normal)
- `gluc`: Glucose level (1 = normal, 2 = above normal)
- `smoke`: Smoking status (0 = non-smoker, 1 = smoker)
- `alco`: Alcohol intake status (0 = non-drinker, 1 = drinker)
- `active`: Physical activity level (0 = inactive, 1 = active)
- `cardio`: Presence of cardiovascular disease (0 = no, 1 = yes)

### 2. `medical_data_visualizer.py`

This Python script analyzes the `medical_examination.csv` dataset and creates visualizations using **seaborn** and **matplotlib**. It performs the following main tasks:
- Calculates the 'overweight' status based on Body Mass Index (BMI).
- Normalizes 'cholesterol' and 'gluc' columns to binary values.
- Defines two plotting functions:
  - `draw_cat_plot()`: Generates categorical plots (bar plots) to visualize variables such as activity level, alcohol consumption, cholesterol, glucose, overweight status, and smoking grouped by cardiovascular disease presence.
  - `draw_heat_map()`: Filters the dataset based on health criteria (blood pressure, height, weight percentiles), calculates the correlation matrix, and visualizes it as a heatmap.

### 3. `main.py`

This script serves as the main entry point to run and invoke both `medical_data_visualizer.py` and `test_module.py`. It orchestrates the execution of the entire project.

### 4. `test_module.py`

This script runs tests to verify the functionality and integrity of the project components, ensuring everything operates as expected.

### 5. `heatmap.png` and `catplot.png`

These PNG files are generated by `medical_data_visualizer.py` and showcase the visual outputs of the analysis:
- **`heatmap.png`**: Shows a heatmap illustrating correlations between health indicators.
- **`catplot.png`**: Displays bar plots comparing lifestyle factors and health indicators among patients with and without cardiovascular disease.
