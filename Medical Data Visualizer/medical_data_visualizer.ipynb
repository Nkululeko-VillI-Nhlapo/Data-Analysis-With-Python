    "### Data Analysis and Visualization on Medical Examination Dataset\n",
    "##### Nhlapo Nkululeko\n",
    "This is a Python script that uses <span style=\"color:blue\">**pandas**</span>, <span style=\"color:blue\">**seaborn**</span>, and <span style=\"color:blue\">**matplotlib**</span> to analyze and visualize data from a CSV file named <code>medical_examination.csv</code>. The script enhances the dataset by calculating a new '<span style=\"color:green\">overweight</span>' column based on <span style=\"color:blue\">**Body Mass Index (BMI)**</span>. It also normalizes the '<span style=\"color:green\">cholesterol</span>' and '<span style=\"color:green\">gluc</span>' columns to binary values for further analysis. Two main functions, <code>draw_cat_plot()</code> and <code>draw_heat_map()</code>, are defined to create insightful visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**<code>draw_cat_plot()</code>** generates categorical plots (bar plots) that highlight variables such as <span style=\"color:red\">activity level</span>, <span style=\"color:red\">alcohol consumption</span>, <span style=\"color:red\">cholesterol</span>, <span style=\"color:red\">glucose</span>, <span style=\"color:red\">overweight status</span>, and <span style=\"color:red\">smoking</span>. These plots are grouped by the presence of <span style=\"color:blue\">**cardiovascular disease**</span>, providing separate insights for patients with and without cardiovascular issues. The results are saved as '<code>catplot.png</code>'.\n",
    "\n",
    "**<code>draw_heat_map()</code>**, on the other hand, filters the dataset based on specific health criteria including <span style=\"color:red\">blood pressure ranges</span>, <span style=\"color:red\">height</span>, and <span style=\"color:red\">weight percentiles</span>. It calculates the <span style=\"color:blue\">**correlation matrix**</span> of the filtered data and presents it as a <span style=\"color:blue\">**heatmap**</span> using seaborn. The heatmap masks the upper triangle, annotates values for clarity, and is saved as '<code>heatmap.png</code>'. This script ultimately aims to uncover correlations between key health indicators and cardiovascular disease, aiding in comprehensive data-driven insights.\n",
