# Data Analysis Projects Repository

This repository contains several data analysis projects, each demonstrating different aspects of data manipulation and visualization using Python and it's libraries.

1. **Sea Level Predictor**: Analyzes historical sea level data to visualize and predict trends using linear regression, producing a plot of sea level rise from 1880 to 2050.

2. **Page View Time Series Visualizer**: Analyzes and visualizes daily page views on the freeCodeCamp.org forum from May 2016 to December 2019 using line charts, bar charts, and box plots.

3. **Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator**: Computes various statistical measures (mean, variance, standard deviation, etc.) for a 3x3 matrix derived from a list of 9 numbers.

4. **Demographic Data Analyzer**: Analyzes demographic data to uncover patterns and trends related to age, education, income, and other factors, providing insights into the dataset.

Each project includes Python scripts for data processing and visualization, unit tests to ensure functionality, and detailed instructions for usage.
