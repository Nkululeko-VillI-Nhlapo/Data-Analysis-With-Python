### Page View Time Series Visualizer

This project is a **Page View Time Series Visualizer**, designed to analyze and visualize daily page views on the [freeCodeCamp.org forum](https://forum.freecodecamp.org) from **<span style="color: #ff6347;">May 9, 2016</span>**, to **<span style="color: #ff6347;">December 3, 2019</span>**. Using powerful data analysis libraries in Python such as **<span style="color: #4682b4;">Pandas</span>**, **<span style="color: #4682b4;">Matplotlib</span>**, and **<span style="color: #4682b4;">Seaborn</span>**, it aims to uncover patterns and trends in the forum's traffic data. This project shows how data visualization techniques can turn raw data into clear and insightful visual stories, helping stakeholders understand user engagement over time.

The project includes three main visualizations:

1. **<span style="color: #32cd32;">Line Chart</span>**: Shows daily page views over the entire period, highlighting overall trends and significant changes.
2. **<span style="color: #ffa500;">Bar Chart</span>**: Summarizes this data into monthly averages, broken down by year, to reveal seasonal patterns and yearly growth.
3. **<span style="color: #8a2be2;">Box Plots</span>**: Provide a detailed look at the distribution of page views across different years and months, helping to identify variations and outliers in the data.

These visualizations offer a deeper understanding of the forum's usage patterns, which can guide future decisions about content and user engagement strategies. Full Code Can be Found Here <span style="color:blue;"  src="">Click</span>
