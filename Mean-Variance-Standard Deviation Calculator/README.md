# 🌟 Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator 🌟

Welcome to the **Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator** project! This project provides a function to calculate the mean, variance, standard deviation, maximum, minimum, and sum of rows, columns, and the entire 3x3 matrix using NumPy.

## 🌟 Introduction

The Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator is designed to handle a list of 9 numerical values, convert it into a 3x3 matrix, and compute various statistical measures. This project is a great example of utilizing NumPy for matrix operations and Python's unittest framework for testing.

## 🔍 How It Works

The core functionality is encapsulated in the `calculate()` function, which performs the following steps:

1. **Validation**: Ensures the input list contains exactly 9 elements.
2. **Matrix Conversion**: Converts the input list into a 3x3 NumPy array.
3. **Calculations**: Computes the mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum along both axes (rows and columns) and for the flattened matrix.
4. **Output**: Returns a dictionary containing the calculated statistics.

## 💻 Installation

To use this project, you'll need to have Python and NumPy installed. You can install NumPy using pip:

```sh
pip install numpy
run the main.py
